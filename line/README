A package for network embedding:

To learn node embedding for an HIN:

1. Construct a set of nodes with the following codes:
line_node node;
node.init(<node file>, <vector dim>);

2. Construct HINs between nodes with the following codes:
line_hin hin;
hin.init(<hin file>, <node left>, <node right>, 0);

3. Add a learner with the following codes:
line_trainer_line learner;
learner.init(&hin, 0);
